## Simple Functions

Take a look at [function syntax](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#defining-functions)
and make the function `start` return the string `"OK"`.

In the tasks the function `TODO()` is used, that throws an exception.
Your job during the koans will be to replace this function invocation with meaningful code according to the problem.
