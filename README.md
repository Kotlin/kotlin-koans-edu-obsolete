### This project is obsolete. The last version of Kotlin Koans is stored at https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans-edu.

# kotlin-koans-edu

The project stores the tasks for: 
- Educational Plugin https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/03/kotlin-educational-plugin
- online version of koans http://try.kotl.in 

You don't need this project if you want to solve the tasks. Install the educational plugin or do it online.

This project converts the task files to different required formats. If you want to contribute to the task content, please make changes to the folder 'Kotlin Koans'. The folders 'Kotlin Koans EE plugin' and 'Kotlin Koans WebDemo' are autogenerated by the code written in src/koans/converter.

You can find the koans in a compiled project that you can solve directly in IDE here: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans.
